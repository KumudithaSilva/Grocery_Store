# Grocery Store Product Management System ðŸ›’
Managing traditional product documentation becomes challenging due to the vast number of products and intricate details, resulting in a significant increase in time consumption and potential inaccuracies arising from mismanagement. However, transitioning to a system-based product management approach provides users with the opportunity to efficiently manage their product portfolio.

## Project Overview ðŸ“Š

The primary objective of this project is to develop a digital PDF document that encompasses the user's order list and corresponding descriptions. In addition, the shop owner can seamlessly insert, update, and retrieve product details. For customers, the system allows the addition of available products to their order list without direct interaction with the seller. The system automatically calculates the price for each item, displaying the cumulative total with every addition to the list. Subsequently, customers have the option to include comments for specific order specifications. Finally, customers can verify their orders and retain the order details for reference.
